# Adding Background Music

To add background music to the birthday page:

1. Place your music file (MP3 format recommended) in this `public` folder
2. Name it `birthday-music.mp3`
3. The music will automatically play when the birthday page loads

**Supported formats:** MP3, OGG, WAV

**Note:** If you don't add a music file, the website will still work perfectly - it just won't have background music. The error in the console is normal and can be ignored.
